## About

This mod implements an alternate health and damage system. The following changes to the base mechanics are made:

1. Players no longer die at zero health. Instead, they enter a knockdown state with severe penalties (slowness, mining fatigue, and weakness).
   1. Healing back up to at least one full heart will revive them.
   2. If a player is not revived within ninety seconds, they will bleed out and die (for real).
2. Any time a player takes damage, they have a chance of gaining an *injury*.
   1. For every injury a player has, one heart of health becomes incapable of healing.
   2. Injuries do not go away on their own, but sleeping through the night will heal one.
